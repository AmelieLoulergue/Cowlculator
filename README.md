# COWLCULATOR 
Helps US farmers to manage their carbon footprint, generate carbon credits & provides data to agricultural research.

## Current concept and features. APP V1

Cowlculator is a free app that helps American farmers to generate carbon credits more efficiently by understanding and managing their carbon balance. Researchers can access farmers' securely stored data to conduct agricultural research which could influence policy makers.

You can try our app: [Cowlculator Online URL](https://cowlculator.netlify.app/)

### **STEP 1**: Farmers take the survey :farmer: :woman_farmer:

When logged in as a farmer, users can take a survey about their farm and the practices implemented to mitigate carbon emissions. If any change occurs on the farm, the user can take it again.

### **STEP 2**: Calculations :abacus:

Cowlculator calculates the carbon emissions, mitigations thanks to the practices implemented on the farm and potential earnings under the form of carbon credits for each tonne of carbon mitigated.

### **STEP 3**: Results communicated :computer: :iphone:

The farmers users can access a personalized, clear and elegant dashboard displaying the current emissions, mitigations and earning of the farm. An evolution of these information is also displayed.

### **STEP 4**: Data stored anonymously on IBM Cloud :cloud:

When a Farmer user takes the survey their information are sent and stored anonymously on a database on the IBM Cloud accessible by an authorized Researcher user for agricultural research purpose.

### **STEP 5**: Actions taken :dart:

Farmers users can take actions on their farm to mitigate their carbon emissions. Researcher users can conduct agricultural research leading to improved agricultural carbon mitigations.

## Goals and upcoming features APP V2

### Feature 1
The current version of the Cowlculator application has for objective to collect and consolidate knowledge and information on farmers' practices. The information gathered will allow the future version of the app to display even more personalized advice to farmers to balance their emissions. Based on previous users' answersthe personalization of the advice will include the location (state, zip code) and the activities of the farm for example. 


### Feature 2 
Give farmers a gamified experience with notifications and reminders to always seek improvement. This feature will enable farmers to compare themselves with other farmers in the same state for example and create a community platform allowing them to share your experience with other farmers or researchers.


### Feature 3
Cowlculator also aims to include free tools to facilitate the implementation of sustainable practices, such as satellite maps of properties to help with grazing management, fertilizer application and a shop with feeding improvement solutions. An estimate of the implementation costs as well as the available financial aids to implement sustainable practices will be added to the farmers' dashboard.


### Feature 4
A forum will be implemented for researchers allowing them to ask questions, publish the latestt news and discuss research topics with their peers. A "News" page will be added, available for both farmers and researchers users, displaying the latest news and policies about sustainable agricultural practices and related topics. In this page, researchers will also be able to publish their articles.

### Feature 5 !
The final objective is for Cowlculator to become the reference tool in the validation process for the carbon credit market thanks to partnerships with carbon credit companies. Cowlculator can also be used as a tool for the validation process of a ‘carbon neutral food’ logo, which would require well-defined specifications and allow the farmers' efforts to be rewarded by a marketing claim.


### Feature 6
Specific agricultural modules will be added to the form in order to estimate the emissions and potential mitigations in a more precise way. Each module will be composed of questions specific to an agricultural product such as vineyard or aquaculture. Before taking the form, the user will be able to select a module and the questions of the module will be added to the core questions list of the form.


### Feature 7
Switch the web application to Android et iOS.
