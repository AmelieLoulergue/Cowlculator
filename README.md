# COWLCULATOR 
Helps US farmers to manage their carbon footprint, generate carbon credits & provides data to agricultural research.

## Current concept and features. APP V1

Cowlculator is a free app that helps American farmers to generate carbon credits more efficiently by understanding and managing their carbon balance. Researchers can access farmers' securely stored data to conduct agricultural research which could influence policy makers.

### **STEP 1** : Farmers take the survey :farmer: :woman_farmer:

When logged in as a farmer, users can take a survey about their farm and the practices implemented to mitigate carbon emissions. If any change occurs on the farm, the user can take it again.

### **STEP 2** : Calculations :abacus:

Cowlculator calculates the carbon emissions, mitigations thanks to the practices implemented on the farm and potential earnings under the form of carbon credits for each tonne of carbon mitigated.

### **STEP 3** : Results communicated :computer: :iphone:

The farmers users can access a personalized, clear and elegant dashboard displaying the current emissions, mitigations and earning of the farm. An evolution of these information is also displayed.

### **STEP 4** : Data stored anonymously on IBM Cloud :cloud:

When a Farmer user takes the survey their information are sent and stored anonymously on a database on the IBM Cloud accessible by an authorized Researcher user for agricultural research purpose.

### **STEP 5** : Actions taken :dart:

Farmers users can take actions on their farm to mitigate their carbon emissions. Researcher users can conduct agricultural research leading to improved agricultural carbon mitigations.

## Goals and upcoming features APP V2

### feature 1
With this version of the application, the objective is to collect and consolidate knowledge and information on farmers' practices. The information will allow research and application to offer better advice to farmers to balance their emissions while obtaining financial aid to implement this advice.

### feature 2 
Give farmers a gamified experience with notifications and reminders to always seek improvement. To be able to compare yourself to other farmers in the same state for example and create a community platform allowing you to share your experience with other farmers or researchers.

### feature 3
The final objective is to become the reference application for the general public as well as for professionals about the involvement of farmers to reduce their emissions by releasing a Carbon Neutral label for example, according to well-defined criteria.
